  <h1>Enginner Muhammad Ali Mirza</h1>
  <p>Muhammad Ali Mirza was born on 4 October 1977 in Jhelum, a city in Punjab,
    Pakistan. He is a 19th grade mechanical engineer in a government department.<br>

    Ali gives online lectures where he talks about different religious issues runs
    a research academy where he imparts religious education based on his own<br>
    understanding of Quran and Sunnat. His critics claim that he uses derogatory terms
    for Islamic Saints and present out of context clips from his lectures as evidence.<br>

    Ali allegedly opined that present day Ahmadis are better than Jews and Christians
    (the people of the book). He, however still declared them as non-Muslims and said <br>
    that his video clips have been presented out of context. He was arrested on 4 May 2020 in suspicion of spreading hate speech towards
    religious scholars. Pakistani
    actor Hamza Ali Abbasi <br>and anchor Shafaat Ali posted on social media condemning his
    arrest. He was later released on 6 May 2020. According to Ali, one of his lectures<br>
    was presented completely out of context. He later said that if one starts presenting
    other opinions in such a way then even the verses of the Qur'an can be presented out
    of context.</p>

  <h1>Dr Zakir Naik</h1>
  <p>Zakir Abdul Karim Naik (born 18 October 1965) is an Indian Islamic televangelist and
    public orator who focuses on comparative religion. He is the founder and president of the <br>
    Islamic Research Foundation (IRF) and the Peace TV Network. Naik has said that his goal is to
    "concentrate on the educated Muslim youth who have become apologetic about their own religion <br>
    and have started to feel the religion is outdated". Naik delivers lectures promoting Islam (dawah),
    often with an associated question and answer session with the audience. He gives lectures in English <br>
    and wears a suit and tie, which is uncommon among Islamic preachers. His lectures are recorded and broadcast on
    Peace TV.

Muslim supporters of Naik praise him as friendly and entertaining, with an appeal that stretches beyond the <br>
traditional audience for dawah. Other Muslims criticise the style and substance of his lectures as inappropriate,
 and dispute some of his doctrinal stances. In broader secular opinion he is frequently alleged to promote <br>
 terrorism and social intolerance, which he strongly denies. In 2016, Indian authorities charged Naik for money
 laundering while abroad in Malaysia. Naik chose to settle in Malaysia and not return to India to avoid arrest. <br>
 The National Investigation Agency unsuccessfully attempted to issue an Interpol red notice for his arrest, due to
 insufficient evidence. Peace TV is banned in India, Bangladesh, Canada, Sri Lanka, and the United Kingdom.</p>
